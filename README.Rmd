The rater package is designed to allow the easy fitting of Bayesian versions of nosiy categorical rating models using [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/).

### IMPORTANT

This package is still in the very early stages of development interfaces will change *without* warning

### INSTALLATION

``` r
# we need a specific version of rstantools
devtools::install_github("stan-dev/rstantools", ref = "c3c59fb")

# you may need to run: `remove.packages("rstantools")` and restart R if rstantools is already loaded

devtools::install_github("Voltemand/rater")

# There (unfortunately) will be many compiler warnings. 
# Don't worry they are harmless but difficult to remove
```

### Usage:

```r
library(rater)

data(anesthesia) # example dataset

# fit the bayesian Dawid and Skene model with default priors
fit <- mcmc(anesthesia, dawid_skene())

# plot the latent class
plot(fit, "latent_class")
```
