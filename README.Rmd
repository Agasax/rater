**rater** provides tools for working with Bayesian models of categorical data 
annotation. The package provides a simple interface to fit a selection of these 
models, with arbitrary priors, using MCMC provided by [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/).
A selection of functions are also provided to plot parts of these models and extract 
key parameters. 

### Usage:

```{r, syntax_demo, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="hide", }
library(rater)
data(anesthesia)

fit <- rater(long_data(anesthesia), dawid_skene()) # sampling output suppressed

plot(fit, type = "raters")
```

### Installation

**rater** requires the **rstan** package to fit models. Detailed instructions to
install **rstan** can be found [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started)

To install the **rater** package run:

```{r, installation_demo, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jeffreypullin/rater")
```

#### Installation notes:

- The installation will download a yet to be released branch of the **rstantools**
repository used to build the package
- The **Stan** models will be compiled at install time - this will lead to an 
install time of few minutes. Please be patient - this compilation means that
**no** compilation is required when using the package
- During the compilation many warnings may be displayed in the terminal these 
are harmless but impossible to suppress.
